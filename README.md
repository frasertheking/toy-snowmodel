# toy-snowmodel

This is a small pet project to create a very simple scheme snow model that can handle both a physical-based (energy balance) approach to melt calculations as well as a temperature-index approach.

The script is written in rust https://www.rust-lang.org using a couple base cargo utils.

The snowmodel uses a variety of empirical values to help model some of the physical processes, and the origin of these values (along with the corresponding formula description) can be found in Chapter 5 of Dingman, 2015.

Happy modelling!
